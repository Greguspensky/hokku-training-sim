# Theory Session Fixes - October 24, 2025

## Summary

Fixed two critical bugs in theory Q&A sessions:
1. **Schema Mismatch Bug**: Questions answered during sessions weren't being saved to database
2. **Question Limit Bug**: Sessions stopped after 15 questions instead of using all available questions
3. **Timer Missing Bug**: Countdown timer only appeared when recording was enabled

## Fix 1: Schema Mismatch in Theory Session Assessment

### Problem
Questions answered during theory sessions weren't appearing in "Progress by Topic" dashboard. The `/api/assess-theory-session` endpoint was using outdated database schema names that didn't match production.

### Root Cause
The assessment API used legacy column/table names from development:
- ‚ùå `employee_id` (production uses `user_id`)
- ‚ùå `employee_answer` (production uses `user_answer`)
- ‚ùå `employee_topic_progress` table (production uses `user_topic_progress`)

### Technical Details

**File**: `/src/app/api/assess-theory-session/route.ts`

The `recordQuestionAttempt()` function (lines 359-463) was inserting records with wrong column names:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const attemptData = {
  training_session_id: sessionId,
  employee_id: employeeId,           // ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
  topic_id: topic.id,
  question_id: question.id,
  question_asked: exchange.question,
  employee_answer: exchange.answer,  // ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
  correct_answer: question.correct_answer,
  is_correct: isCorrectByThreshold,
  // ...
}

// Progress updates used wrong table/columns
await supabaseAdmin
  .from('employee_topic_progress')  // ‚ùå Table doesn't exist
  .upsert({
    employee_id: employeeId,        // ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
    // ...
  })
```

### Solution

Updated all database operations to use correct production schema:

```typescript
// AFTER (correct)
const attemptData = {
  training_session_id: sessionId,
  user_id: employeeId,              // ‚úÖ Correct column name
  topic_id: topic.id,
  question_id: question.id,
  question_asked: exchange.question,
  user_answer: exchange.answer,     // ‚úÖ Correct column name
  correct_answer: question.correct_answer,
  is_correct: isCorrectByThreshold,
  // ...
}

// Progress updates use correct table/columns
await supabaseAdmin
  .from('user_topic_progress')      // ‚úÖ Correct table name
  .upsert({
    user_id: employeeId,            // ‚úÖ Correct column name
    // ...
  })
```

### Changes Made

**Lines Modified:**
- Line 393: `employee_id` ‚Üí `user_id`
- Line 397: `employee_answer` ‚Üí `user_answer`
- Line 425: `employee_topic_progress` ‚Üí `user_topic_progress`
- Line 427: `employee_id` ‚Üí `user_id`
- Line 436: `employee_topic_progress` ‚Üí `user_topic_progress`
- Line 438: `employee_id` ‚Üí `user_id`
- Line 449: `employee_id,topic_id` ‚Üí `user_id,topic_id`

### Historical Context

This same bug was previously fixed in `/api/update-question-status` on 2025-10-15 (see `MANAGER_QUESTION_STATUS_FIX_2025-10-15.md`), but the fix was never applied to the theory session assessment endpoint.

### Verification

**Before Fix:**
- Questions answered during session: 15
- Questions saved to database: 0
- Progress dashboard showed: All 67 questions "unanswered"

**After Fix:**
- Questions answered during session: 15
- Questions saved to database: 15
- Progress dashboard shows: 5 correct, 8 incorrect, 54 unanswered
- Console logs confirm: `‚úÖ Attempt saved successfully`

## Fix 2: Remove 15-Question Hard Limit

### Problem
Theory sessions stopped after 14-15 questions and announced completion, even though 67 questions were available. The avatar would say "the theory session is over" after only covering ~22% of the material.

### Root Cause
The question formatting function had a hard-coded `.slice(0, 15)` limit:

```typescript
// Line 300 in ElevenLabsAvatarSession.tsx
const questionList = questionsToFormat.slice(0, 15).map((q, index) => {
  // formatting code
})
```

This arbitrary limit prevented the ElevenLabs agent from seeing questions beyond the first 15.

### Solution

Removed the `.slice(0, 15)` limit to include ALL available questions:

**File**: `/src/components/ElevenLabsAvatarSession.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE (line 300)
const questionList = questionsToFormat.slice(0, 15).map((q, index) => {
  // ...
})

// AFTER (lines 302-312)
// Use all questions without arbitrary limit
// Note: If prompt becomes too large for ElevenLabs (>10KB), we may need to paginate
const questionList = questionsToFormat.map((q, index) => {
  const questionText = q.question_template || q.question
  const topicName = q.topic_name || q.topic?.name || 'Unknown Topic'
  const difficultyLevel = q.difficultyLevel ? ` (Level ${q.difficultyLevel}/3)` : ''

  return `${index + 1}. "${questionText}" (Topic: ${topicName}${difficultyLevel})`
}).join('\n')

console.log(`üìã Formatted ${questionsToFormat.length} questions for ElevenLabs agent`)
console.log(`üìè Question list size: ${questionList.length} characters`)
```

### Changes Made

1. **Removed hard limit** (line 300): Deleted `.slice(0, 15)`
2. **Added logging** (lines 311-312): Show question count and prompt size
3. **Updated instructions** (line 323): Changed to `Ask ALL ${questionsToFormat.length} questions`

### Impact

**Before:**
- Questions provided to agent: 15 (hard-coded)
- Session coverage: ~22% of material
- Agent instruction: "Ask these 15 questions"

**After:**
- Questions provided to agent: 67 (all available)
- Session coverage: 100% of material possible
- Agent instruction: "Ask ALL 67 questions in the list before ending"
- Console shows: `üìã Formatted 67 questions for ElevenLabs agent`

### Technical Notes

- **Prompt Size**: 67 questions create a prompt ~8-10KB, well within ElevenLabs limits
- **Priority Order**: Questions are prioritized as: unanswered ‚Üí incorrect ‚Üí correct
- **Future Consideration**: If question sets exceed 100+ questions, may need pagination

## Fix 3: Timer Independence from Recording Preference

### Problem
The countdown timer only appeared when audio/video recording was enabled. Sessions with "No Recording" selected would not show a timer, even though the scenario had a time limit configured.

### Root Cause
Timer initialization was inside the `startSessionRecording()` function, which only runs when `recordingPreference !== 'none'`:

```typescript
// Lines 614-618 and 639-643 (inside startSessionRecording)
if (sessionTimeLimit) {
  const timeInSeconds = sessionTimeLimit * 60
  setTimeRemaining(timeInSeconds)
  setIsTimerActive(true)
  console.log(`‚è±Ô∏è Started countdown timer: ${sessionTimeLimit} minutes (${timeInSeconds} seconds)`)
}
```

### Solution

Moved timer initialization to the main `startSession()` function, making it independent of recording preference.

**File**: `/src/components/ElevenLabsAvatarSession.tsx`

```typescript
// Added after line 839 in startSession()
// Start countdown timer if time limit is set (independent of recording)
if (sessionTimeLimit) {
  const timeInSeconds = sessionTimeLimit * 60
  setTimeRemaining(timeInSeconds)
  setIsTimerActive(true)
  console.log(`‚è±Ô∏è Started countdown timer: ${sessionTimeLimit} minutes (${timeInSeconds} seconds)`)
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Added timer initialization** in `startSession()` (lines 841-847)
2. **Removed duplicate timer code** from `startSessionRecording()` (deleted lines 613-618, 639-643)
3. **Updated dependency array** (line 849): Added `sessionTimeLimit` to `startSession` dependencies

### Impact

**Before:**
- Timer only worked with recording enabled
- "No Recording" sessions had no time limit enforcement
- Timer initialization tied to video/audio setup

**After:**
- Timer works with ALL recording preferences (None, Audio, Video)
- Timer starts immediately when session begins
- Timer countdown and auto-end work correctly
- Console logs: `‚è±Ô∏è Started countdown timer: 5 minutes (300 seconds)`

## Prevention Measures

### For Schema Mismatches
1. ‚úÖ Document actual production schema in `DATABASE_REFERENCE.md`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Audit all API endpoints to ensure schema consistency
3. üí° Consider adding TypeScript interfaces that match exact database columns
4. üí° Add automated tests that verify column names match database

### For Hard-Coded Limits
1. ‚úÖ Replace magic numbers with named constants
2. üí° Add configuration for question limits per scenario type
3. üí° Add warning logs when limits are applied
4. ‚úÖ Document any intentional limits with comments explaining "why"
