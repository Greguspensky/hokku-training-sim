# Settings Reorganization - Manager Dashboard

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Reorganized manager settings into a dedicated **Settings** section with separate pages for different configuration areas. This improves navigation, reduces clutter on the main dashboard, and provides a scalable structure for future settings.

---

## What Changed

### Before
- **Default Training Language** selector was embedded in the Training Tracks header
- **Recording Options** configuration was displayed directly on the main dashboard
- Settings mixed with main content (tracks and scenarios)

### After
- **Clean main dashboard** with focused Training Tracks section
- **Dedicated Settings hub** at `/manager/settings` with navigation cards
- **General Settings page** at `/manager/settings/general` for language & recording options
- **Voice Settings page** at `/manager/settings/voices` for ElevenLabs voice management

---

## New File Structure

```
src/app/manager/settings/
├── page.tsx                    # Settings hub with navigation cards
├── general/
│   └── page.tsx               # Language & recording options
└── voices/
    └── page.tsx               # Voice management (existing)
```

---

## Pages Created

### 1. `/manager/settings` - Settings Hub
**Purpose**: Central navigation for all settings pages

**Features**:
- Card-based navigation
- Visual icons for each settings category
- Clear descriptions of what each settings page configures

**Navigation Cards**:
- **General Settings** → Language & recording options
- **Voice Settings** → ElevenLabs voice management

### 2. `/manager/settings/general` - General Settings
**Purpose**: Configure training defaults and recording options

**Settings Included**:
1. **Training Language by Default**
   - Dropdown selector for default session language
   - Applies to all new employee training sessions
   - 13 language options with flag emojis

2. **Recording Options by Scenario Type**
   - Configure Theory Q&A recording options (audio, video)
   - Configure Service Practice recording options (audio, video)
   - At least one option must be selected per scenario type
   - Controls employee dropdown menu options

**Features**:
- Real-time save indicators
- Validation (at least one option required)
- Clear help text and notes
- Responsive grid layout

## Modified Files

### `src/app/manager/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed default language selector from Training Tracks header
- ✅ Removed recording options configuration section
- ✅ Cleaned up state management (kept for now but can be removed if not used elsewhere)
- ✅ Simplified Training tab to focus on tracks and scenarios

**Before** (lines 620-772):
```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6 mb-6">
  <div className="flex items-start justify-between mb-4">
    <div className="flex-1">
      <h2>Training Tracks</h2>
      ...
    </div>
    {/* Default Language Selector */}
    <div className="ml-6 flex-shrink-0">
      ...language dropdown...
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* Recording Options Configuration */}
  <div className="mt-6 border-t pt-6">
    ...recording options...
  </div>
</div>
```

**After** (lines 620-625):
```tsx
<div className="mb-6">
  <h2>Training Tracks</h2>
  <p>Create and manage training tracks...</p>
</div>
```

---

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)

All settings use the existing `/api/company-settings` endpoint:

**GET**: Load settings
```typescript
fetch(`/api/company-settings?company_id=${companyId}`)
```

**POST**: Update settings
```typescript
fetch('/api/company-settings', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    company_id: companyId,
    default_training_language: 'ru',
    theory_recording_options: ['audio', 'audio_video'],
    service_practice_recording_options: ['audio', 'audio_video']
  })
})
```

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Navigation
**Before**: Users had to scroll down on the Training tab to find settings
**After**: Clear "Settings" navigation (can be added to header/sidebar)

### Organization
**Before**: Settings mixed with operational content
**After**: Settings isolated in dedicated area

### Scalability
**Before**: Adding new settings would clutter the main dashboard
**After**: New settings can be added as cards in settings hub or new sub-pages

---

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Settings Pages
1. **Company Settings** - Company name, branding, timezone
2. **Notification Settings** - Email/SMS notifications for completions
3. **Integration Settings** - Third-party integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.)
4. **Billing & Usage** - Subscription management, usage metrics
5. **Security Settings** - Password policies, 2FA requirements

### Navigation Improvements

## Migration Notes

### No Database Changes Required
- All settings continue using existing `company_settings` table
- No schema migrations needed
- Fully backward compatible

### Deployment
1. Deploy new settings pages
2. Updated manager dashboard will work immediately
3. No data migration required
4. No user action needed

---

## Code Cleanup Opportunities

### Manager Dashboard State (Optional)
The following state variables can potentially be removed from `/manager/page.tsx` if not used elsewhere:
- `defaultLanguage`
- `savingLanguage`
- `theoryRecordingOptions`
- `servicePracticeRecordingOptions`
- `savingRecordingOptions`
- `loadCompanySettings()`
- `handleLanguageChange()`
- `handleRecordingOptionsChange()`

**Recommendation**: Keep for now to avoid breaking any hidden dependencies. Remove in future cleanup PR if confirmed unused.

## Documentation Updates

### Updated
- ✅ This document (`SETTINGS_REORGANIZATION_2025-10-28.md`)

### Should Update
- `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Add settings navigation section
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` - Add settings page troubleshooting
