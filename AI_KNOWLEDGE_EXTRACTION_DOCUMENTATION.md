# AI Knowledge Extraction System Documentation

## Overview

This document covers the intelligent question pool system that replaces random LLM question generation with structured, document-based training content. The system uses GPT-4 to analyze company knowledge base documents and automatically generate contextual training questions.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Knowledge Extraction Service** (`src/lib/knowledge-extraction.ts`)
2. **Database Schema** (knowledge assessment tables)
3. **API Endpoints** (`/api/test-ai-extraction`)
4. **Testing Scripts** (multiple test files for validation)

### Database Tables

#### Core Tables
- `knowledge_topics` - AI-extracted learning topics with difficulty levels
- `topic_questions` - Generated questions linked to specific topics
- `user_topic_progress` - Employee progress tracking
- `question_attempts` - Individual question attempt history
- `topic_prerequisites` - Topic dependency management

#### Sample Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE knowledge_topics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  company_id UUID NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT CHECK (category IN ('menu', 'procedures', 'policies', 'general')),
  difficulty_level INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_level BETWEEN 1 AND 3),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE topic_questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  topic_id UUID REFERENCES knowledge_topics(id),
  question_template TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_type TEXT CHECK (question_type IN ('multiple_choice', 'open_ended', 'true_false')),
  correct_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer_options TEXT[],
  points INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  explanation TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## AI Extraction Process

### 1. Document Analysis Phase

**Input**: Company knowledge base documents from `knowledge_base_documents` table
**Process**:
- Load all documents for specified company
- Analyze document content using GPT-4o-mini
- Extract structured learning topics with categories and difficulty levels

**GPT-4 Topic Extraction Prompt**:
```
Analyze this coffee shop document and extract distinct learning topics that employees should master.

Document: "{doc.title}"
Content: """
{doc.content}
"""

For each topic, provide:
1. name: Short, clear topic name (e.g., "Cappuccino Sizes", "Espresso Preparation")
2. description: Brief description of what employees need to know
3. category: One of: menu, procedures, policies, general
4. difficulty_level: 1=beginner, 2=intermediate, 3=advanced

Focus on actionable knowledge that can be tested with specific questions.

Return response as JSON array:
[
  {
    "name": "Topic Name",
    "description": "What employees need to learn",
    "category": "menu|procedures|policies|general",
    "difficulty_level": 1|2|3
  }
]
```

### 2. Question Generation Phase

**Input**: Extracted topics + original document content
**Process**:
- Generate 2-3 questions per topic using GPT-4o-mini
- Create multiple choice, open-ended, and true/false questions
- Include correct answers, explanations, and point values

**GPT-4 Question Generation Prompt**:
```
Create 2-3 training questions about "{topic.name}" for employee assessment.

Topic Details:
- Name: {topic.name}
- Description: {topic.description}
- Category: {topic.category}
- Difficulty: {topic.difficulty_level}/3

Context from company document:
"""
{doc.content}
"""

Generate questions that test specific knowledge employees need for their job.

For each question provide:
1. question_template: The question text
2. question_type: "multiple_choice", "open_ended", or "true_false"
3. correct_answer: The correct answer
4. answer_options: Array of options (for multiple_choice only, 3-4 options)
5. points: 1-5 points based on difficulty
6. explanation: Why this answer is correct

Return as JSON array:
[
  {
    "question_template": "What sizes are available for cappuccino?",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "correct_answer": "250ml, 350ml, 450ml",
    "answer_options": ["250ml, 350ml, 450ml", "Only 350ml", "200ml, 400ml", "Small, Medium, Large"],
    "points": 2,
    "explanation": "According to our menu, cappuccino comes in three sizes: 250ml, 350ml, and 450ml"
  }
]
```

## Integration Points

### Adaptive Question Selection
The generated questions integrate with the existing adaptive selection algorithm:

```javascript
// Priority-based selection considering:
// 1. Employee's current mastery level per topic
// 2. Question difficulty relative to employee skill
// 3. Topic categories needed for role requirements
// 4. Historical attempt success rates

const selectedQuestions = await adaptiveQuestionSelector({
  employeeId,
  topicPool: aiGeneratedTopics,
  questionPool: aiGeneratedQuestions,
  sessionLength: 10,
  focusAreas: ['menu', 'procedures']
});
```

### ElevenLabs Session Integration
Questions can be dynamically loaded into conversational AI sessions:

```javascript
const examinerInstructions = generateExaminerPrompt(selectedQuestions);
const knowledgeContext = formatKnowledgeBase(relatedDocuments);

await elevenlabsConversation.start({
  examinerInstructions,
  knowledgeContext,
  trainingMode: 'structured_assessment'
});
```
