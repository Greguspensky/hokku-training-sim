# Intelligent Product Knowledge Assessment System

## Overview

A comprehensive system that replaces random LLM-generated questions with structured, topic-based assessment that tracks learning progress and adapts to employee knowledge levels.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All components have been implemented and are ready for integration once database tables are created.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (`knowledge-assessment-schema.sql`)
- **knowledge_topics**: Structured topics extracted from company documents
- **topic_questions**: Question pools with templates and correct answers
- **employee_topic_progress**: Individual mastery tracking per topic
- **question_attempts**: Detailed attempt history for analysis
- **topic_prerequisites**: Learning paths and dependencies

### 2. Knowledge Extraction Service (`src/lib/knowledge-extraction.ts`)
- **AI-powered topic extraction** from company documents using GPT-4
- **Automatic question generation** with multiple choice, open-ended, and true/false formats
- **Category classification**: menu, procedures, policies, general
- **Difficulty assessment**: 1=beginner, 2=intermediate, 3=advanced
- **Deduplication and quality control**

### 3. Question Pool Management (`src/lib/question-pool-manager.ts`)
- **Adaptive question selection** based on employee progress
- **Mastery-level tracking** with 0-100% scoring
- **Template-based question generation** as fallback
- **Risk assessment**: identifies employees needing attention
- **Progress statistics** and learning analytics

### 4. Employee Progress Dashboard (`src/components/EmployeeProgressDashboard.tsx`)
- **Visual progress tracking** with mastery indicators
- **Topic-by-topic breakdown** with difficulty levels
- **Learning recommendations** based on performance
- **Achievement recognition** for completed topics
- **Personal statistics** and recent activity

### 5. Manager Analytics Interface (`src/components/ManagerAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`)
- **Company-wide performance overview**
- **Employee risk identification** (high/medium/low attention levels)
- **Topic difficulty analysis** - identifies problematic areas
- **Training effectiveness metrics**
- **Time-filtered reporting** (7d, 30d, 90d, all time)

### 6. Adaptive Training Session (`src/lib/adaptive-training-session.ts`)
- **Structured question delivery** instead of random LLM generation
- **Real-time progress tracking** and score calculation
- **Automatic answer evaluation** with multiple methods
- **ElevenLabs integration** with structured prompts
- **Session results and improvement recommendations**

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Question Pool Orchestration
‚úÖ **Topic-Based Organization**: Questions organized by knowledge categories
‚úÖ **Difficulty Progression**: Easy ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced pathways
‚úÖ **Template System**: Reusable question formats with variables
‚úÖ **Database-Driven**: All questions stored and managed in database
‚úÖ **Admin Interface Ready**: Managers can review/edit question pools

### Progress Interface Design
‚úÖ **Employee Dashboard**: Personal mastery view with topic indicators
‚úÖ **Manager Analytics**: Company-wide progress and risk assessment
‚úÖ **Session Results**: Detailed performance breakdown per session
‚úÖ **Learning Paths**: Visual representation of knowledge acquisition
‚úÖ **Improvement Tracking**: Identifies and tracks knowledge gaps

### Adaptive Intelligence
‚úÖ **Priority-Based Selection**: Focuses on unmastered topics first
‚úÖ **Difficulty Adaptation**: Adjusts question complexity to employee level
‚úÖ **Repetition Avoidance**: Prevents asking same questions repeatedly
‚úÖ **Mastery Assessment**: 3/3 correct = topic mastered (configurable)
‚úÖ **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Template generation when DB questions unavailable

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Extraction Pipeline
```
Company Documents ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Topics + Questions ‚Üí Database Storage
```

### 2. Adaptive Session Flow
```
Employee Login ‚Üí Progress Analysis ‚Üí Question Selection ‚Üí ElevenLabs Delivery ‚Üí Answer Evaluation ‚Üí Progress Update ‚Üí Recommendations
```

### 3. Question Selection Algorithm
```
1. Get employee's current progress
2. Identify topics below mastery threshold (80%)
3. Sort by: lowest mastery ‚Üí fewest attempts ‚Üí difficulty
4. Select questions from priority topics
5. Generate from templates if database lacks questions
```

## üìä Analytics & Insights

### Employee Level
- **Mastery Percentage**: 0-100% per topic
- **Learning Velocity**: Questions per session trend
- **Difficulty Comfort**: Performance by question complexity
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Topics requiring attention

### Manager Level
- **Company Performance**: Average mastery across organization
- **Risk Identification**: Employees struggling or inactive
- **Topic Analysis**: Which knowledge areas are most challenging
- **Training ROI**: Effectiveness metrics and improvement tracking

## üöÄ Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Database Setup
Apply the schema to your Supabase database:
```sql
-- Run knowledge-assessment-schema.sql in Supabase dashboard
```

### 2. Initial Knowledge Extraction
```javascript
// Extract topics from existing company documents
const { topics, questions } = await KnowledgeExtractionService.extractAndGenerateKnowledge(companyId)
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration
Add to employee dashboard:
```jsx
import EmployeeProgressDashboard from '@/components/EmployeeProgressDashboard'
// Add to employee portal
```

Add to manager dashboard:
```jsx
import ManagerAnalyticsDashboard from '@/components/ManagerAnalyticsDashboard'
// Add to manager portal
```

### 4. Replace ElevenLabs Integration
Update training sessions to use:
```jsx
import { AdaptiveTrainingSession } from '@/lib/adaptive-training-session'
// Replace current ElevenLabsAvatarSession with adaptive version
```

## üéâ Benefits Achieved

## üéØ User Question Answered

**"Did I understand correctly that you will make question pools per topic, instead of just randomly looking at the knowledge base and figuring out what questions can there be?"**

**Yes, exactly!** The system now uses structured question pools organized by topic rather than random LLM generation. Here's how it works:

1. **Topics are extracted** from your company documents and organized by category
2. **Question pools are created** for each topic with predefined templates
3. **Employee progress is tracked** per topic to identify knowledge gaps
4. **Questions are selected adaptively** from pools based on what each employee needs to learn
5. **Progress is visualized** in dashboards showing topic completion and mastery levels

This ensures consistent, relevant questions that build systematically on knowledge rather than random, repetitive queries.
