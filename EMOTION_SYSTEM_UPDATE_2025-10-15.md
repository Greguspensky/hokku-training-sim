# Customer Emotion System Update - October 15, 2025

## Summary

Complete redesign of customer emotion levels for more intuitive naming and addition of "Cold" customer personality type.

## Changes Made

### 1. Emotion Level Renaming

| Old Name | New Name | Icon | Reason |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| calm | **sunshine** | ‚òÄÔ∏è | "Sunshine" better captures warm, positive energy that brightens employee's day |
| frustrated | **in_a_hurry** | ‚è±Ô∏è | More specific - describes time pressure, not general frustration |

### 2. New Emotion Level: "Cold" üßä

**Customer Type**: Urban, emotionally reserved, skeptical megapolis citizen

**Personality Traits**:
- Neutral and matter-of-fact (not warm, not hostile)
- Slightly moody and hard to read
- Ironical, satirical, can punch a joke
- Won't smile unless employee earns it
- Respects authenticity, dismisses fake enthusiasm

**Speech Patterns**:
- Minimal responses: "Mm.", "Sure.", "Whatever."
- Dry, deadpan delivery
- Sarcastic edge: "Oh, *that's* interesting."
- Can tease: "So this is the 'artisanal' version, huh?"
- Short answers, doesn't elaborate unless engaged

**Behavioral Goals**:
- Get what they need without emotional labor
- Cooperative IF reasoning makes sense
- Tests employee authenticity
- Will accept logical upsells: "Fine, add it."
- Might warm up slightly if employee is genuine/funny
- Never enthusiastic, but can be "reluctantly amused"

**Training Use Case**:
- Reading subtle emotional cues
- Staying professional with neutral/skeptical customers
- Not over-selling or being fake
- Earning trust through competence, not charm
- Handling sarcasm without getting defensive

### 3. Complete Emotion Progression

Now ordered from easiest to most challenging:

1. **Sunshine** ‚òÄÔ∏è (Beginner) - Warm, positive, easy customer
2. **Cold** üßä (Intermediate) - Neutral, skeptical, tests authenticity
3. **In a Hurry** ‚è±Ô∏è (Intermediate) - Time-pressured, impatient
4. **Angry** üò† (Advanced) - Upset, demanding de-escalation
5. **Extremely Angry** ü§¨ (Expert) - Furious, advanced conflict mastery

## Files Modified

### Code Changes (TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/customer-emotions.ts` - Updated type definition and all emotion definitions
- ‚úÖ `src/components/ElevenLabsAvatarSession.tsx` - Updated default values (2 instances)
- ‚úÖ `src/components/ScenarioForm.tsx` - Updated initial form state
- ‚úÖ `src/components/EditScenarioForm.tsx` - Updated fallback value

### Database Migration (SQL)
- üìù `migrations/2025-10-15_update_emotion_levels.sql` - Migration script created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual execution required** - See `MANUAL_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Documentation
- üìÑ `MANUAL_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step SQL execution guide
- üìÑ `EMOTION_SYSTEM_UPDATE_2025-10-15.md` - This file

## Next Steps

### Required: Manual Database Migration

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You must manually execute the SQL migration in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy SQL from `migrations/2025-10-15_update_emotion_levels.sql`
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify emotion levels updated successfully

See `MANUAL_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed steps.

### Optional: Test Scenarios

After database migration, test the emotion system:

1. Create a new Service Practice scenario
2. Try the new "Cold" üßä emotion level
3. Verify "Sunshine" ‚òÄÔ∏è and "In a Hurry" ‚è±Ô∏è renamed correctly
4. Check that existing scenarios migrated properly

## Technical Details

### Type Definition
```typescript
export type CustomerEmotionLevel = 'sunshine' | 'cold' | 'in_a_hurry' | 'angry' | 'extremely_angry'
```

### Default Value
All forms and fallbacks now use `'sunshine'` as the default instead of `'calm'`.

### Database Constraint
```sql
CHECK (customer_emotion_level IN ('sunshine', 'cold', 'in_a_hurry', 'angry', 'extremely_angry'))
```

## Benefits

1. **More Intuitive Names**: "Sunshine" and "In a Hurry" are clearer than "Calm" and "Frustrated"
2. **Gap Filled**: "Cold" fills the missing neutral/skeptical customer type
3. **Better Training**: Wider range of realistic customer personalities
4. **Urban Context**: "Cold" reflects big-city customer service realities
5. **Authentic Scenarios**: More variety for employee practice

## Impact on Russian Camera Obscura Scenario

The "Cold" customer type is perfect for sophisticated coffeehouse scenarios:
- Matches urban customer expectations
- Allows for natural, indirect communication style
- Tests barista's ability to engage skeptical guests
- Fits well with "natural guest behavior" prompts
