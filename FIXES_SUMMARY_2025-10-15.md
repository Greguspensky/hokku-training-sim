# Quick Fix Summary - 2025-10-15

## Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ✅ Manager Question Status Update - FIXED
**Problem:** Managers couldn't manually override question status (correct/incorrect/unanswered)

**Error:** `500 Internal Server Error - Could not find 'employee_answer' column`

**Root Cause:** API was using outdated schema names (`employee_answer`, `employee_id`, `employee_topic_progress`)

**Solution:** Updated to production schema (`user_answer`, `user_id`, `user_topic_progress`)

**File Changed:** `/src/app/api/update-question-status/route.ts`

---

### 2. ✅ Progress Calculation - FIXED
**Problem:** Progress showed 100% when only 2/76 questions were answered correctly

**Root Cause:** Formula calculated `correct / attempted` instead of `correct / total`
- Old: `2 correct / 2 attempted = 100%` ❌
- New: `2 correct / 76 total = 2.6%` ✅

**Solution:** Changed formula to use total questions instead of attempted questions

**File Changed:** `/src/app/api/question-progress/route.ts`

---

## Testing Verification

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ POST /api/update-question-status → 500 Error
Progress: 100% (incorrect)
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ POST /api/update-question-status → 200 OK
Progress: 3% (correct - 2/76 = 2.6% rounded to 3%)
Console: "✅ Created new question attempt record"
```
